## Layout Structure
- **Homepage:** A dashboard composed of individual cards representing key functions such as Production Orders, Downtime Analytics, Maintenance Logs, and Reports.
- **Navigation:** A top navigation bar with the company logo and menu items for Home, Orders, Analytics, and Profile.
- **Detailed View:** Clicking a card transitions the user to a detailed view that displays in-depth data tables and additional charts.

## Core Components

- **Data Tables:** Detailed tables for production orders, maintenance logs, and downtime reports, accessible through the cards.
- **Navigation Bar:** A consistent header providing access to main sections.

## Interaction Patterns

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme
- **Primary Color:** #47C0CF for interactive elements, highlights, and buttons.

- **Readability:** Ample spacing between lines and sections to ensure text is easily readable on all devices.

## Accessibility
